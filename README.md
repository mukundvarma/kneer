# kneedr - Knee point detection in R. 

This package implements the kneedle algorithm by Satopää et al, published [here](https://raghavan.usc.edu//papers/kneedle-simplex11.pdf) in R. 
It derives (a lot of) inspiration from the equivalent (excellent) python module [kneed](https://github.com/arvkevi/kneed).
