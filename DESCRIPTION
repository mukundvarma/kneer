Description: kneer is an R implementation of the kneedle algorithm proposed by
	Satopaa et al. in the paper titled 'Finding a "Kneedle" in a Haystack:
	Detecting Knee Points in System Behavior.' <doi:10.1109/ICDCSW.2011.20>.
	Briefly, the Kneedle algorithm works by finding points of maximum curvature
	in curves. This package implements functions to easily run the kneedle
	algorithm to calculate knee points, and a ggplot2 `stat` layer for overlaying
	calculated knees on top of point or line curves.
